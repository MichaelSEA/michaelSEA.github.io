          <p>I am excited by designing and creating elegant software that delights users, regardless of whether the user is an end-user or another developer consuming an API that I have created.

          <h2>Senior Program Manager at Microsoft <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">Redmond</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/da-dk/mdcc">Copenhagen</a>, Denmark)</h2>
          <p class="subDetails"><b>1999 - 2010</b></p>
          <p>I worked on and shipped lots of cool stuff at Microsoft, and I also got to work with some very smart and talended people. After 11 years though, I was drawn back to 'pure development' which gives me great creative joy, and smaller, more agile teams where you have to wear different hats at different times, and do everything!</p>
          <p>While at Microsoft I shipped:</p>
          <p class "subDetails"><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/visio/"><b>Visio</b></a> in 2001/2002. I worked on SVG, the XML file format, 'Save to Web' features as well as a 'Next-Generation Visio' design with team architects.</p>
            <p class "subDetails"><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/net"><b>.NET Framework</b></a> in 2003/2004. I worked on the Base Class Libraries (BCL), FxCop tool and created a 14-part Designing .NET Class Libraries course and some of the design guidelines for .NET code.</p>
          <p class "subDetails"><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics/erp-ax-overview.aspx"><b>Dynamics Client</b></a> from 2004-2007 in Copenhagen. I was part of a small team that created a <a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2008/06/microsoft-dynamics-ax-2009-adds-ten-core-features/">common client and UX</a> for three different Dynamics CRM products.</p>
          <p class "subDetails">I also worked on <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/netdocs-microsofts-net-poster-child/"><b>NetDocs</b></a> (a SaaS-based Office) owning the extension/plugin architecture, and <a href="http://visualstudiomagazine.com/blogs/redmond-review/2010/09/death-of-oslo.aspx"><b>Oslo</b></a> (a graphical DSL and modeling tool) which did not ship, although I received patents for some of my work on those projects.</p>

                    <p class="subDetails">1991 - 1999</p>
          <p>At NGN I went from a contract software engineer creating sockets-based applications to Director of Development in 1995 and CTO in 1996.  I was the primary architect and implementor (along with my team of four developers and two contract developers) of what was at the time "the largest out-of-home digital advertising network in the US".</p>
          <p>NGN was a 'push-media network' that sent news/weather/sports scores/lottery results as well as advertisements to thousands of locations across the US, mostly 7-11 stores, but also news kiosks and transit stations.</p>
          <p>We created lots of software machinery to enable NGN including web-based clients for buying ads and job tracking/workflow for graphic artists, a custom sliding-window PPP protocol to deliver media over phone, a remote media player and comm client running in store locations and lots more.</p>
          <p>NGN raised approx. $115M in venture capital and we <a href="assets/ngn_comdex.html">won 'Best Application' at the 1999 Comdex Windows World Open competition</a>.</p>
          <p>My work there was mostly C++/MFC for services and MTS/DCOM with (D)HTML and javascript-based clients and lots and lots of SQL Server tuning and redundancy.</p>
          <p>NGN was <a href="https://www.noovie.com/">purchased by Regal Cinema Chain in 2001</a> and is now used throughout theaters in the US to deliver digital media content before feature films.</p>
